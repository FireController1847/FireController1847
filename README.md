# Hi, I'm Fire! ðŸ”¥

## What do I do? ðŸ”­

I'm a Software Programmer and Developer, experienced in various programming languages. I am also a User Interface and User Experience designer, and have significant experience in the field of Computer Science.

## What's my focus? âš¡

I strive to focus on the speed, accessibility, and customizability of modern software. I strive to make software development easier for developers and to make software easier to use for users. It is my goal to make software that does exactly what you want it to do every single time you go to use it.

That's a pretty hefty goal! But it won't stop me! How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.
