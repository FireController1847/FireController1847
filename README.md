# To Add a Page
Adding a page is simple. Make a new folder. Copy the home page's index.html file. Optionally add a title or one will be autogenerated from the URL. And the `showdown.js` file should do everything else.

Every element that's common to all pages will be added by the `showdown.js` file.

## Options

You can add a few attributes to the `markdown` section if you want to add some options. They are listed below.

- `data-no-table-of-contents`: Disables the table of contents.
