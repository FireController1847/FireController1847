# Explanation of the Rules {explanation}
**This is not a comprehensive document.** There may be restrictions we assume are implied, included in external, linked documents, or of which are covered by a “catch-all” statement. This document is provided to give you a better understanding of the exact expectations for your behavior in our community.  
  
If you have any questions not answered by this document, please direct them to your local community moderators, as they will have the final say in any situational decisions based on their individual interpretations of these rules. These rules encourage and support those individual interpretations.  
  
## Always try your best to improve yourself. {rule1}
### What does this mean?
- This means you are expected to be on your best behavior at all times.
- Our servers encourage learning, proactive mindsets, and mindfulness towards personal growth in both behavior and communication.
  
### Why do we have it?
- With everyone on the same page for the same goal, we foster a community supporting growth, learning, education, positivity, and understanding.
  
## The Discord ToS and the Discord Guidelines are enforced in this server. {rule2}
### What does this mean?
- This means that we actively monitor for, encourage, and ultimately enforce the guidelines as found in the *[Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms/)* and the *[Discord Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines/)*.
- Both of these documents are provided in an easy-to-understand, human-readable format, and are not legalese. As such, we expect you, as a member of our community, to both read and adhere to these terms, services, and guidelines.
  
### Why do we have it?
- Both the Discord Terms of Service and the Discord Guidelines mimic our cores, values, and expectations for those who participate in our community.
  
## Respect everyone and everything. {rule3}
### What does this mean?
- If you are not certain what the term respect means in this context, that is generally up to individual interpretation. You will be given ample warnings if a behavior is believed to be falling outside of these understandings, assuming such behavior is not classified as extreme or requiring immediate attention.
- Oxford Languages defines respect as:
    - “Due regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or traditions of others.”
- Some synonyms include:
    - Consideration, thoughtfulness, attentiveness, politeness, courtesy, civility, and deference.
- Basically, be a good person, and follow the golden rule.
    - “Treat others as you would want to be treated by them,”  
- Or, as defined by the Bible:
    - “In everything do to others as you would have them do to you, for this is the Law and the Prophets” (Matthew 7:12, NRSV).  
    - “Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets” (Matthew 7:12, KJV).
  
### Why do we have it?
- Mutual respect is the core of fostering a supportive, uplifting, and positive community. If you cannot respect each other’s individual beliefs, viewpoints, and understandings, you are not welcome in our community.
  
## Soliciting without invitation is prohibited. Absolutely no invitations of contention. {rule4}
### What does this mean?
- In terms of soliciting:
    - No soliciting advertising without verbal consent of a moderator.
    - No forcing your opinion of a certain subject upon others.
    - Do not claim that others must follow the same beliefs as yourself.
    - Or any behavior related to the three statements made above.
- In terms of “invitations of contention:”
    - Contention is defined as a “heated disagreement,” “an assertion … maintained in argument,” or “strife, arguing, and disputations.” While we do encourage respectful debates, doing so with ill-intent is not allowed.
  
### Why do we have it?
- Whilst we do encourage supportive understanding and consistently learning new things, we do not encourage doing so through rudeness, misunderstandings, blaming, and fighting.
- Respectful debates are always encouraged. Claiming one’s opinion is worse than yours is not. Humble yourself.
  
## Uphold righteous language and behavior. {rule5}
### What does this mean?
- This does not mean you cannot swear. However, we expect you to behave righteously within our community. We expect you to uplift one another, rather than tear one another down. And we expect you to try your best to be a good person.
- What is “righteous” is up to your individual interpretation. If it misaligns with a given moderator’s interpretation, you are expected to uphold the moderator’s interpretation.
    - A moderator's interpretation may not be perfect. Understanding that people make mistakes is a vital part of participating in our community. You will still be expected to uphold the moderator’s final call, even if it is wrong, until said moderator is corrected, if it is applicable. You are always welcome to inform other moderators of the misbehavior if you believe the moderator is in violation of the rules in their interpretation.
    - If you have a moral issue with this, we remind you that you are never forced to participate in our community. We always reserve the right to take moderative action against behavior that does not follow our rules.
  
### Why do we have it?
- Our community does not support disruptive, hurtful, or angry, contentious discussions. We encourage forming new friendships, loving one another, and continuous learning through righteous language and behavior.
  
## Avoid excessive swearing or sexually suggestive terminology. {rule6}
### What does this mean?
- We do not allow excessive swearing. What is considered “excessive” is up to the moderator’s discretion, and you will be aptly informed and given ample warning if you begin to overlap this rule.
- Excessive swearing can make a community less welcoming for others, or make them uncomfortable. It also displays a lack of maturity, respect, and understanding. We expect you to maintain respect for others, including inanimate objects such as concepts, countries, or another’s personal possessions, at all times.
- For a similar reasoning as excessive swearing, sexually suggestive terminology (including excessive innuendoes) is also not allowed.
  
### Why do we have it?
- We want to ensure that everyone feels welcome in our community. As such, we do not outright ban swearing or sexual innuendoes. However, if the behavior becomes a commonality or it begins to make others feel uncomfortable, we reserve the right to move the bar to help everyone feel welcome.
    - You lose nothing by withholding this behavior. You can control what you say. Others cannot control what they hear.
  
## Moderators have the final say in any situation. {rule7}
### What does this mean?
- Moderators reserve the right to end conversations, to determine the outcome of any discussion, or to “have the final say in any situation.”
- Moderators’ interpretation of the rules is always upheld, and this rule will catch-all any behavior that may not be explicitly listed in the rules.
- We reserve the right to correct you for behavior we feel does not align with the general understanding of the rules, including behavior that is not within the “spirit of the rules,” or the intended meaning behind them.
  
### Why do we have it?
- We are not perfect. As such, these rules are not perfect and cannot fully contain every possible situation that may occur in our community. This rule is intended to help us maintain the “spirit of the law,” to catch situations that we do not want in our community that may not otherwise be covered by these rules.
    - These situations will always be handled on a case-by-case basis.
  
## Final Words
These rules are designed to give you the most optimal experience as you participate in our community. Adhering to them will help everyone feel welcome, loved, and accepted in a world of growing contention, chaos, and passionate disagreements. We welcome you, and hope you feel welcome in our community.
